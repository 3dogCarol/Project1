##Means and standard deviations of measurements from Wearable Technology
________________________________________________________________________________

We have data collected from 30 subjects wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist who preform 5 activities - (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). From the data we create a file containing all the data entries which are means or standard deviations of the measurements produced by the smartphone and collected. Using the document features.txt which comes with the original data we can determine which the type of measurement is in each column of data.

We combine the training data with the test data and only pick out the variables which are means of the measurements or standard deviations of the measurements. Altogether there are 86 such variables.

We then compute the mean of the values for each subject, activity and variable. The results are the final output.

After pulling the data from the original data we attach the headers for each column.
Here is a list of the 86 variables that we collected from the data.
We also included the number of the subject and the number of the actitity as the first two columns of the data set.
